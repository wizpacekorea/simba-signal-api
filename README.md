```
**client_id** is required all the time, should be generated by the signal maker and should be unique, in case two different signals or the same client_id are sent the last one will be ignored an error will be returned.

**symbol** should be the same as the symbols provided by the exchange originally through the API, for future's API e.g. Bitmex (XBTUSD, ETHUSD.....) for spot exchanges it can be different depending on the market e.g. Binance (BTC/USDT). Try making a request directly to the exchange to see if they accept your order.

**type** limit, market - currently only those two are supported, others will be added later.

**qty** the amount to execute in ratio. e.g. if you want to sell 10% of your portfolio qty=0.1, if you want to sell 1000% (10x leverage) then 10. Provide the field in string format for accuracy since parsing json floats in scientific notation could lead to inacurracies 

**price** the price to execute, not required for market orders. Provide in string format for accuracy

**leaves_qty** the amount of portfolio expected to remain after this order executes, e.g I want to close 25% of my position and remain with only 75% then leaves_qty = 0.75. Its valid for [-1,1]. If on short position leaves_qty can be negative

**side** buy, sell - only two sides (don't use long or short, we'll automatically execute all buy as long and sell as short)

**valid_before** the limit time for the signal, if before execution current_time > valid_before then the signal won't be executed. In Unix timestamp (int) until seconds 1607402327 (don't send milliseconds or nano)

**sent_at** the time you sent the signal. In Unix timestamp (int) until seconds 1607402327 (don't send milliseconds or nano)

### Response
